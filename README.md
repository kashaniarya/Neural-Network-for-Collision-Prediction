# Neural-Network-for-Collision-Prediction
Collect training data for a robotics task. Develop a neural network to enable a small robot to navigate a simulated environment without collisions. Key components are data collection, PyTorch DataLoader setup, custom network architecture design, and model training.The evaluation focuses on collision prediction model accuracy.
